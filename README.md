# A2A Translator
Desktop tool for converting A2A Spec text into complete, multi-file software projects.

## Overview
The A2A Translator is the official compiler of the A2A ecosystem. It takes A2A-formatted project text generated by an AI model and converts it into a real directory structure with real files. The Translator guarantees deterministic output: whatever A2A text you provide is exactly what gets built.

## Features
- Paste or load A2A project text
- Automatically generates folders and files according to the A2A Spec
- Validates formatting and warns about malformed structures
- Full filesystem generation with status logs
- Windows-native Electron application
- Fully offline for privacy and security

## Installing the Application (End User)
1. Go to the Releases section of this repository.
2. Download the latest Windows installer (.exe).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Launch A2A Translator from the Start Menu or from the shortcut.

The installed version behaves like any normal Windows desktop application.

## How to Use the Application (End User)
1. Open A2A Translator.
2. Paste your A2A project text into the input box.
3. Click “Choose Output Folder” and select where the project should be created.
4. Click “Generate Project.”
5. The app creates all files and folders defined in your A2A text.
6. Open the generated folder in your editor (VS Code, etc.) and run your project.

## Developer Setup (Running from Source)
To run the Translator in development mode:
- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
- Clone this repository to your machine.
- Open a terminal in the project folder.
- Run:
  npm install
  npm start

This starts the app in Electron’s development environment with hot reload.

## Building the Windows Executable (Developer)
To build an installer (.exe) from source:
1. Install project dependencies with:
   npm install
2. Run the build script:
   npm run build
3. When the build completes, the final installer and unpacked build will appear in the dist/ or out/ folder (depending on your configuration).

You can share this installer, upload it to Releases, or use it for distribution.

## A2A Workflow Summary
1. Use an AI model trained on the A2A Spec to generate valid A2A project text.
2. Validate the text if needed using A2A Inspector.
3. Paste the A2A text into the Translator.
4. Choose the output folder and generate the full project.
5. Open the generated files and run or modify your application.

## Part of the A2A Ecosystem
- A2A Spec: Defines the official deterministic project format.
- A2A Inspector: Validates A2A project structure before translation.
- A2A Translator: Converts validated A2A text into real project files.
